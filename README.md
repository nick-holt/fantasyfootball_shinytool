This project is a shiny app that scrapes and visualizes live data from fantasypros.com

The app allows the user to select a variety of positions and scoring formats and displays the relationship between expert consensus rankings and expert consensus point projections.

Hovering over a data point in the vis will populate the table below with information about the specific player.
